    "### Executive Summary:\n",
    "In this exercise, dynamic programming is examined, where an algorithm and program is created using dynamic programming to solve knapsack problems. A knapsack problem consists of items, weights and values for the items, and the maximum weight capacity that the *knapsack* can hold. The goal of a knapsack problem is to determine the number of each item to include, where the total weight is less than or equal to the maximum weight capacity, and the total value is as large as possible.  It is an NP complete (or weakly NP complete) problem as every possible set of combinations would need to be calculated to come up with a globally optimal solution using an exact algorithm. Basically, dynamic programming is a technique to solve NP complete problems where an approximate solution using a greedy algorithm would not provide an adequate optimal solution (far from optimal). It starts by solving subproblems and builds up to solve the bigger problem. For example, in a knapsack problem, an algorithm that is dynamically programed will begin by solving the problem for smaller knapsacks, and then will work its way up to solve the original problem. The example problem that is run through the program built in this exercise has four items where the values are 3,000, 2,000, 1,500, and 1,000, with respective weights of 400, 200, 100, and 100, and a maximum weight capacity of 400. It is a simple example that is used to clearly show how dynamic programming can come with an optimal solution. Further explanation on how the algorithm works, and its relationship to Big O notation is discussed in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results of the example problem, it is recommended that an algorithm using dynamic programming is used to solve NP complete problems in which a greedy algorithm would produce an approximate solution that is far from optimal. Though there are cases where an algorithm programmed with dynamic programming may be slower than an approximation algorithm, it is an effective means of providing a reliable solution especially when issues require finding a global optimum. Therefore, it is important for the data engineer to know how to create such algorithms, as approximate solutions do not apply to every use case.         "

    "### Define Function for Dynamic Programming - Knapsack: \n",
    " - An algorithm created using a dynamic programming approach will find an optimal solution by solving subproblems and then work up to solving the original problem.\n",
    " - Every dynamic programming algorithm starts with a grid or matrix. In a knapsack problem, the rows will generally be the items, and the columns will be the maximum weight broken up into different sizes (e.g 100 to 400 pounds). Each row and column cell represents a subsolution to a subproblem. The grid or matrix initially starts off empty. The goal is to fill each cell with the maximum value of an item or combination of items without exceeding the maximum weight capacity for that respective column (e.g 100 to 400) [1].  \n",
    " - Going from left to right of the columns are the different knapsack sizes, and going from top to bottom are the items that can be included into the knapsack. Except for the first row, every succeeding row will provide the option of choosing to fill each cell, across columns, with either the current row item value, previous row item value, or a combination of the item values from previous rows, which can also include the current row item value. Every cell filled is based on the maximum total value, as long as the total weight does not exceed the maximum weight capacity for the respective column. As the first row is the starting point, the cells for the row and column can only be filled with the same value. In addition, item values for subsequent rows after the current row cannot be used; only the rows above it. The order of the rows do not matter as well. After filling all the cells, the value of the cell in the final row and column will be the solution to the original problem. \n",
    " - For a knapsack problem, each cell's value is therefore calculated with the following formula [1]:\n",
    "  - where i = row; j = column\n",
    "  - cell[i][j] = max of { \n",
    "    - 1. previous max: value of cell[i-1][j]\n",
    "    - 2. or value of current item + value of the remaining space (cell[i-1][j-item's weight]) }\n",
    " - It is guaranteed that dynamic programming will generate an optimal solution as it considers all possible cases and chooses the best. It is mainly an optimization for recursion [2].\n",
    " - Dynamic programming is best used in cases where an approximation algorithm is unsuitable, such as in partitioning and replication [3]. It is useful to the data engineer to know how to create a dynamic programming algorithm, as there are many use cases of NP complete problems that require an optimal solution that is ideal, where processing time becomes secondary. An example would be in rebalancing partitions to prevent or reduce machine failures that can be very costly.\n",
    " - Big O notation is written as **O(*nW*)** time, where *n* is the number of items, each of which has a weight *w(i)* and value *v(i)*, and the capacity of the knapsack is ***W***. In an NP complete problem, finding the exact solution takes **O(*n!*)** time. For a knapsack problem with 32 items, an exact algorithm would have to go through 4 billion possible sets [1]. On the other hand, in the case of 32 items with a maximum weight capacity of 50, a dynamic programming algorithm would have a 32 x 50 grid with 1,600 cells."

    " - In this example problem, a greedy algorithm will first pick the highest value that will fit into the knapsack. Then it will go onto the next value, and so on. Since it is an algorithm that at each step will pick the locally optimal solution, it will stop with the first step as being the globally optimal solution, as 3,000 is the highest value, and no other item will fit afterwards. However, it is a solution that is far from optimal. \n",
    " - On the other hand, the algorithm using a dynamic programming approach solved the problem by solving it through subproblems. It split up the problem into a grid that essentially had 16 subsolutions, the last being the best solution, which was a total value of 4,500. Therefore, instead of returning 3,000 as the highest value, it returned the combined values of 2,000, 1,500, and 1,000, where the total weight did not exceed the maximum weight capacity. The resulting solution is far better than what a result from a greedy algorithm would be.         "

It was a simple example that was used to clearly show how dynamic programming can come with an optimal solution that is better than an approximation algorithm, such as a greedy algorithm. In this example problem, a greedy algorithm would have picked the highest value to fit the knapsack, which was 3,000, and would have stopped as no other value would have been able to fit after. Since it is an algorithm that at each step will pick the locally optimal solution, the result would have been far from optimal. On the other hand, the algorithm using a dynamic programming approach solved the problem by solving it through subproblems returning the combined values of 2,000, 1,500, and 1,000, totaling 4,500, where the total weight did not exceed the maximum weight capacity. The resulting solution was far better than what a result from a greedy algorithm would be.\n",
