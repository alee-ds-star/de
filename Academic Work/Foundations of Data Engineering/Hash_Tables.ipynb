    "### Executive Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise hash tables are examined by creating a dictionary data structure that uses hashing in the back-end. A hash table is a data structure that has keys and values that are mapped together. Basically, a hash function will map strings to numbers, or key values, that are combined into an array creating a hash table. Retrieving data from a hash table is very fast, making them powerful and useful, especially to the data engineer. It is an effective means to store and search data due to its performance and flexibility, particularly when dealing with complex data. It is recommended that hash tables are used for storing data, though collisions and load factors can become an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following exercise compares the performance of hash tables with two other search algorithms, linear and binary search. Linear search works by searching one item at a time, and will eliminate one item at a time if there is not a match. On the other hand, binary search works by taking the middle item and eliminates half the items every time if the search value is not found based on the \"guesses\" being either too high or too low. Further explanation on how the search algorithms work in relation to hash tables are detailed in this exercise. In addition, their relation to Big O notation is also discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison, a list of 100 randomly generated names were created. They were stored in an unsorted array, and a dictionary data structure was created based off the names. 5 random names were searched using linear search and dictionary search. The names in the unsorted array were then sorted using quicksort, and 6 names were selected based on the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, 90th, and 100th positions. The 6 names were then searched using binary and linear search, and were also retrieved from the dictionary that was based off the original unsorted array. Execution times were recorded. With regards to its effectiveness and performance, retrieving data from the dictionary showed the best results.          "

    " - The following four functions will be used for this exercise. They are for linear search, binary search, dictionary search, and quicksort. The search algorithms will be used to compare performance between searching from an array using linear and binary search, and retrieving from a dictionary (or hash table). "

    "#### Linear Search:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Big O Run time as **O(*n*)**, also known as linear time.\n",
    " - Linear search \"guesses\" one number at a time and eliminates one number at a time.\n",
    " - For example, if there are 100 items, if items are a sorted list and the max number is the right number, it will take 100 steps to get to that value. This will roughly take 100ms to run. It is also important to note that Big O does not tell you the speed in seconds. It tells how fast the operation grows [1].\n",
    " - Run time in Big O Notation for Linear Search is *n* as each element is checked.\n"

    "#### Dictionary Search:\n",
    " - On average (best case), Big O Run time as **O(1)**, and the value expressed is also known as constant time.\n",
    " - The constant is the fixed amount of time it takes to retrieve the item from the dictionary or hash table. **O(1)** time does not mean instant.\n",
    " - In the case of a dictionary or hash table, it does not matter if the table has 1 or a million items; getting an item from the hash table takes the same amount of time [1]. \n",
    " - **O(1)** constant time is the average case; however at its worst case it can take **O(*n*)** time due to collisions.\n",
    " - Collision happens when two keys have been assigned to the same slot. A linked list can be used at the slot to mitigate collision, but can cause a significant slow down in the hash table if the linked list gets too large.\n",
    " - Therefore, having a good hash function, or one that distributes values evenly, and a low load factor is important. A load factor is basically the ratio of items in the hash table over the total number of slots. A general rule of thumb is to have a load factor lower than 0.7. A load factor can be reduced with resizing. \n",
    " - It is also important to note that in the average case, or the best case, insertion and deletion of data also take **O(1)** time. At its worst, they can take **O(*n*)** time as well.  "

    " - For example, if there are 100 items, and half the items are eliminated every time with binary search, it will take seven steps to find the position of the value (as opposed to worst case being a 100 steps with linear search time). 100 items roughly takes 7ms to run*.\n",
    " - Run time in Big O Notation for Binary Search is log base 2 as log *n* elements are checked in the worst case [1].\n",

    " - Dictionary search is significantly better than the other 2, as it takes **O(1)** time. \n",
    " - **O(1)** time as discussed in the above is constant time. It does not necessarily mean that it is instant; however, it means that the time that is taken will remain the same, regardless of how big the hash table is [1].\n",
    " - Although binary search is better than linear search, and is very quick as it takes **O(*log n*)** time, the **O(1)** constant of dictionary search will at many times be quicker, as the number of items does not matter, whereas the number of items still matter for binary search.\n",
    " - It is also important to note that whether the names are sorted or not does not make a difference for dictionary search, though they make a significant difference with binary search (binary search will not work unless the data is sorted). Therefore, sort time and search time must be considered when assessing binary search versus dictionary search. \n",
    " - However, dictionary search will only be the fastest in the average case. If something is wrong, such as collisions, it will take **O(*n*)** time and binary search will be faster [1]."

    "In this exercise hash tables were examined by creating a dictionary data structure that used hashing in the back-end. Basically, a hash table is a data structure that has keys and values that are mapped together. Retrieving data from a hash table is very fast, making them powerful and useful, especially to the data engineer. It is an effective means to store and search data due to its performance and flexibility, particularly when dealing with complex data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following exercise compared the performance of hash tables with two other search algorithms, linear and binary search. Linear search works by searching one item at a time, and will eliminate one item at a time if there is not a match. On the other hand, binary search works by taking the middle item and eliminates half the items every time if the search value is not found based on the \"guesses\" being either too high or too low.\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison, a list of 100 randomly generated names were created. They were stored in an unsorted array, and a dictionary data structure was created based off the names. 5 random names were searched using linear search and dictionary search. The names in the unsorted array were then sorted using quicksort, and 6 names were selected based on the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, 90th, and 100th positions. The 6 names were then searched using binary and linear search, and were also retrieved from the dictionary that was based off the original unsorted array. Execution times were recorded. With regards to its effectiveness and performance, retrieving data from the dictionary showed the best results.\n",

    "In Big O notation, on average, dictionary search, insertion, and deletion will take **O(1)** time. The value expressed is also known as constant time, or the fixed amount of time it takes to complete a task. However, at its worst case it can take **O(*n*)** time due to collisions. Big O Run time for linear search is **O(*n*)**, also known as linear time, as each *n* element is checked. For binary search, Big O Run time is **O(*log n*)**, also known as log time. Log in this case is base 2 as log *n* elements are checked in the worst case. Although binary search is better than linear search, and is very quick as it takes **O(*log n*)** time, the **O(1)** constant of dictionary search will at many times be quicker, as the number of items does not matter, whereas the number of items still matter for binary search. In addition, whether or not items are sorted does not make a difference for dictionary search, though they make a significant difference with binary search, as the algorithm will not work properly unless the data is sorted.         \n",

    "Based on the results it is recommended that hash tables are used for storing data, though collisions and load factors can become an issue. It is therefore important for the data engineer to know how hash tables are implemented and how they function, as they are critical to building a well-rounded, effective, and efficient system. "
