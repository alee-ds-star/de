    "### Executive Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise Dijkstra's algorithm is examined by finding the fastest way from NYC to Los Angeles through a weighted connections graph showing the hours (or weights) it would take going from city to city. Basically Dijsktra's algorithm works by finding the \"cheapest\" node (city), or the node that we can get to in the least amount of time, update the the costs (hours) of the neighbors of the node (city), and repeat until this is done for every node (city) in the graph [1]. Then the final path is calculated, where the fastest path is found through the lowest costs (hours) of neighboring nodes (cities). The algorithm in this exercise is compared with the breadth-first search algorithm, which instead of finding the fastest path, it finds the shortest. The breadth-first search algorithm will find the shortest path between two nodes that are connected to other nodes by the unweighted edges. The algorithm will first determine if there is a path leading from one node to the other, and it will then find the shortest path by searching the entire network of connections finding the shortest path connections between the two nodes. Thus, in this exercise, the path and the total hours from start to destination is evaluated. Execution times are also recorded. Further explanation on how the algorithms work, and their relationship to Big O notation is discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results of this exercise, it is recommended that the Dijkstra's algorithm is used for cases where a weighted connections graph is necessary for a fastest path problem. It is useful to the data engineer to know how the algorithm works and how it is implemented, as it is an effective means to solve complex problems involving weighted edges, where other search algorithms cannot be easily applied.

    "#### Dijkstra's Algorithm:\n",
    " - Dijkstra's algorithm will find the fastest path between two nodes that are connected to other nodes by weighted edges.\n",
    " - Dijsktra's algortihm has four steps [1]:\n",
    "  - Find the cheapest node that has the smallest weight or the lowest cost from the starting node and its neighbors.\n",
    "  - Check whether there is a cheaper path to the neighbors of this node, and if so, update their costs.\n",
    "  - Repeat until this done for every node in the graph.\n",
    "  - Calculate the final path.  \n",
    " - Dijkstra's algorithm only works with directed acyclic graphs (DAG). A DAG is a finite directed graph with no directed cycles.\n",
    " - Dijkstra's algorithm basically works by:\n",
    "  - Initially the algorithm is set up where the current costs to neighboring nodes are tracked, and all other costs are set to infinity as they have not been reached from the start yet. The cost for the final node is also set to infinity. \n",
    "  - Neighboring nodes are usually tracked by a parent node. As the cheapest paths are found through each node's neighbors, costs are updated and is associated with each parent.\n",
    "  - As updating costs of neighboring nodes gets repeated the final cost to the last node gets calculated through each parent leading to the starting node. \n",
    "  - The algorithm finally determines the fastest path by calculating the lowest costs leading to the final node. \n",
    " - In terms of Big O notation, at its worst case, assuming that the graph is using a self-balancing binary search tree, it is written as **O(|E|+|V|)log|V|)**. |V| is for the number of vertices, and |E| is for the number of edges, or connections. When an entire network is searched, each edge is followed, and so the run time is at the least, **O(number of edges)**. There is also a queue for every node that is to be searched, and adding one node to the queue takes **O(1)** constant time. Doing this for every node will take **(O number of nodes)** total. **log |V|** is the time that it takes to go through neighboring vertices. Therefore, total run time is **O(|E|+|V|)log|V|)** in the case of a self-balancing binary search tree [2].\n",
    " - It is important to note that Dijkstra's algorithm cannot work with weighted edges that are negative. In this case, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used. "

    "#### Breadth-first Search:\n",
    " - A breadth-first search algorithm helps to answer two questions [1]: \n",
    "  - 1.) Is there a path from node A to node B? \n",
    "  - 2.) What is the shortest path between node A to node B?  \n",
    " - Therefore, a breadth-first search algorithm will find the shortest path between two nodes that are connected to other nodes by edges.\n",
    " - The algorithm will search the entire network of connections until it finds the shortest path to the node that is being searched.\n",
    " - Breadth-first search works by radiating out from the starting point. It will check first degree connections before second degree connections, third degree connections before second degree connections, and so on.\n",
    " - Additionally, the algorithm searches nodes in the order that they are added. In other words, it uses a data structure called a *queue*, which works by using a FIFO (First In, First Out) method; the first item that is added to the queue is the first item that is taken off the queue [1]. It uses this data structure so that first degree connections are searched before second degree connections.    \n",
    " - The algorithm is thus implemented by first adding all first degree connections to a queue, which will then \"pop\" a node off the queue and see if it is the specific node that is being searched. If it is not the node, it will then add all neighboring connections to the queue, and it will continue the process until the node is found or the queue is empty.\n",
    " - In terms of Big O notation, it is written as **O(V+E)**. V is for the number of vertices, and E is for the number of edges, or connections. When an entire network is searched, each edge is followed, and so the run time is at the least, **O(number of edges)**. There is also a queue for every node that is to be searched, and adding one node to the queue takes **O(1)** constant time. Doing this for every node will take **(O number of nodes)** total. Therefore, total run time is **O(V+E)** [1].\n",
    " - In contrast to Dijkstra's algorithm, breadth-first search works on unweighted edges, finding the shortest path through the least amount of segments.  "

    " - However, the total hours to get from start to destination are starkly different. Although breadth-first search found the shortest path, the total hours to get to the destination using the shortest path is 46 hours. On the other hand, Dijkstra's algorithm determined that with 8 different cities, it would take 8 hours, by finding the fastest path. \n",

    "  - In the case of using graphs to model, for example, how the transfer of data is mapped between distributed systems, Dijkstra's algorithm is probably better suited as edges are weighted by time, where the execution time of the algorithm is not as high of a priority [3].\n",
    " - Therefore, both algorithms strongly depend on case, where inefficient mappings between systems or inefficient seaches based on complex data problems can affect overall run-time, resulting in poor program performance and client dissatisfaction.    \n",

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "In this exercise Dijkstra's algorithm was examined by finding the fastest way from NYC to Los Angeles through a weighted connections graph showing the hours (or weights) it would take going from city to city. Basically Dijsktra's algorithm works by finding the \"cheapest\" node (city), or the node that we can get to in the least amount of time, update the the costs (hours) of the neighbors of the node (city), and repeat until this is done for every node (city) in the graph [1]. Then the final path is calculated, where the fastest path is found through the lowest costs (hours) of neighboring nodes (cities). The algorithm in this exercise was compared with the breadth-first search algorithm, which instead of finding the fastest path, it finds the shortest. The breadth-first search algorithm will find the shortest path between two nodes that are connected to other nodes by the unweighted edges. The algorithm will first determine if there is a path leading from one node to the other, and it will then find the shortest path by searching the entire network of connections finding the shortest path connections between the two nodes. Thus, in this exercise, the path and the total hours from start to destination was evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of Big O notation, at its worst case, assuming that the graph is using a self-balancing binary search tree, Dijsktra's algorithm is written as **O(|E|+|V|)log|V|)** [2]. |V| is for the number of vertices, and |E| is for the number of edges, or connections. When an entire network is searched, each edge is followed, and so the run time is at the least, O(number of edges). There is also a queue for every node that is to be searched, and adding one node to the queue takes O(1) constant time. Doing this for every node will take (O number of nodes) total. log |V| is the time that it takes to go through neighboring vertices. Therefore, total run time is **O(|E|+|V|)log|V|)** in the case of a self-balancing binary search tree. Breadth first search has similar notation, yet it is written as **O(V+E)**, as it does not account for the weighted edges. Therefore, breadth-first search runs faster. It is also important to note that Dijkstra's algorithm cannot work with weighted edges that are negative. In this case, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this exercise showed that while execution times were significantly different, it was a better trade-off, as Dijskstra's algorithm did its job by finding the fastest path to get from NYC to Los Angeles where the total time calculated  was 18 hours, and the total time calculated for breadth-first search was 46. In this case results showed that it is best to go through a network of weighted edges using Dijkstra's algorithm at the cost of a longer execution time, than finding the shortest path through a network of weighted edges using breadth-first search with a shorter execution time. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore recommended that the Dijkstra's algorithm is used for cases where a weighted connections graph is necessary for a fastest path problem. One example is in mapping data transfer between distributed systems. It is thus useful to the data engineer to know how the algorithm works and how it is implemented, as it is an effective means to solve complex problems involving weighted edges, where other search algorithms cannot be easily applied.
