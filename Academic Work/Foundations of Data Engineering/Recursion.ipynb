    "### Executive Summary:\n",
    "In this exercise the recursive algorithm is examined by using it to compute factorials of 10 random numbers between 100 and 500. A recursive algorithm basically works by having a function call itself until it reaches a solution for the value/item specified. For example, if you have a box that contains other boxes, but one contains a key, recursion works by going through a box, then goes through every item in the box, if the key is not found, it will go through another box, and repeat the process until the key is found[1]. Recursion is therefore used to make finding a solution clearer; however, performance can be an issue as well as memory usage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive algorithm used to compute factorials was compared with a FOR loop in relation to performance. The FOR loop modeled in this exercise looked similar to the recursive algorithm; however instead of calling itself, it went from range (n) and reached a solution by iterating through the range. In certain contexts, a loop will perform better than recursion, and may take up less memory. Further explanation on how these algorithms work are explained in this exercise, and how they relate to Big O notation is discussed. Based on the results, it is recommended that a loop algorithm is used for scenarios where memory and performance is an issue for a recursive algorithm. With regards to its simplicity and efficiency, a recursive algorithm is recommended for the benefit of the programmer if memory and performance do not become and issue, which is especially useful to the data engineer.

    "### Define Recursive Function for Factorial:\n",
    " - Every recursive function has two parts: the base case, and the recursive case [1].\n",
    " - The recursive case is when the function calls itself, and the base case is when the function does not call itself again.\n",
    " - Every time there is a function call, the computer saves the values for all the variables for that call into memory, which is called a \"call stack\".\n",
    " - Once the function reaches the base case it will not call itself again and all calls will be returned. \n",
    " - All stacks will essentially be \"popped\" off.\n",
    " - Big O run time as **O(*n*)**, as it basically runs on linear time or more specifically, linear time complexity [2]. However, if there is too much memory that is used up by the call stack getting too large, performance can be an issue.\n",
    " - In this case, it seems that the recursive algorithm may be used as a matter of preference or context. It is useful to understand, and can apply to many other scenarios due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, If performance becomes an issue, a loop is recommended, which is examined further.\n",
    " - Many important algorithms use recursion. Therefore, it is important for the data engineer to understand the concept."

    " - As discussed in the above, the difference in execution times between the recursive algorithm versus the FOR loop shown in the plot are significant.\n",
    " - In a scenario such as this it could be recommended that a FOR loop should be used rather than recursion if the computational complexity rises, as the differences in time grew with larger numbers.\n",

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "In this exercise the recursive algorithm was examined and compared with a loop algorithm using a FOR loop in relation to performance. Factorials of 10 random numbers between 100 and 500 were computed using both algorithms. A recursive algorithm basically works by having a function call itself until it reaches a solution for the value/item specified. The FOR loop modeled in this exercise looked similar to the recursive algorithm; however instead of calling itself, it went from range (n) and reached a solution by iterating through the range. Recursion is used to make finding a solution clearer; however, performance can be an issue as well as memory usage. In certain contexts, a loop will perform better than recursion, and may take up less memory. However, many important algorithms use recursion, and it is important for the data engineer to understand the concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to Big O notation, both are noted as having a **O(*n*)** run time. However, in this exercise, memory seemed to have been an issue as the recursive algorithm had call stacks that affected performance, and the difference in execution times were significant. Based on the results, it is recommended that a loop algorithm is used for scenarios where memory and performance is an issue for a recursive algorithm. With regards to its simplicity and efficiency, a recursive algorithm is recommended for the benefit of the programmer if memory and performance do not become and issue, which is especially useful to the data engineer. Though they both accomplish the same thing, the tradeoff between program performance and programmer performance should be weighed and taken into consideration in the context of client satisfaction. "
