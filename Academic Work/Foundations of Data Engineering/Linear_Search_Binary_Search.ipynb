    "### Executive Summary:\n",
    "In this exercise, two search algorithms are examined, binary search and linear or simple search. Binary search works by taking the middle value and eliminates half the values every time if the search value is not found. On the other hand linear search works by searching one number at a time. The following exercise will show how the two differ by comparing execution times of the algorithms, and explaining in detail how the algorithms work. Further explanation on how search algorithms relate to what is called Big O notation is dicussed and expanded upon. \n",
    "\n",
    "5 random data sets were created with different sizes (512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192) using a random number generator. Search algorithms were run and execution times were noted followed by a comparison between execution times. Results showed that binary search times were considerably lower than linear search times. It is recommended that binary search algorithms should be used for data engineering applications as higher response times can affect client satisfaction considerably. "

    "### Plot of Execution Times by Size of Dataset:\n",
    " - As discusses in the above, the difference in linear search times versus binary search times in the plot are significant.\n",
    " - It is recommended that binary search should be used rather than linear search times, as the significant differences grow with larger dataset sizes. \n",
    " - Longer search times affect client satisfaction. As in the case with Amazon, they found that an a 100 ms increase in response time reduces sales by 1%**. For a company that makes roughly 200 billion in revenue annually (2018), that would mean with a 1% reduction in sales due to increased response time would affect roughly two billion in revenue.    "

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "In this exercise, two search algorithms were examined, binary search and linear or simple search. Binary search works by taking the middle number and eliminates half the numbers every time if the search value is not found based on the \"guesses\" being either to high or too low. On the other hand, linear search works by searching one number at a time, and will eliminate one number at a time if there is not a match. Binary search cuts down the steps considerably to find the matching value, as a data set with 512 numbers at its worst case scenario will take 9 steps. Linear search at its worst case scenario will take 512 steps with the same dataset. However, binary search requires that the list be in sorted order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search and linear search are expressed in *Big O* notation, which tells you how fast an algorithm is. Binary search in Big O notation is written as **O(log *n*)**, also known as **log time**. Additionally, the log in Big O notation always means log base 2. Therefore, 8,000,000,000 items would take around 33 guesses at its worst. On the other hand, linear search in Big O notation is written as **O(*n*)**, which is also known as **linear time**. At its worst linear search would take 8,000,000,000 guesses to find the right value. Big O notation expresses time in the worst case scenario. That is, if a linear search is run and the item searched is found in the first record, it does not mean that it took O(1) time. Therefore, simple search is expressed in **O(*n*)** time. Additionally, Big O does not tell you the speed in seconds; it instead lets you compare the number of operations telling you how fast an algorithm grows*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results in the exercise showed the effectiveness of binary search over linear search. The significant difference between binary and linear search times is evidenced with the biggest dataset of 8192 random values. As it only took a maximum of 13 steps to find the right number, as opposed to 8192 steps, this made a a huge impact on execution time. Therefore, it is evident that binary search algorithms should be used in data engineering applications. Just like in the Amazon example described in the above, a slight increase in response time can indeed impact client satisfaction.    "
